Hi! My name is Charlie Newey, and I'm a data scientist working in flight safety
for [Flight Data Services][fds]. I build software and machine learning models
for... well, lots of reasons really. Sometimes for fun, sometimes for work.
Sometimes to diagnose problems with aircraft data, sometimes to predict prices
of expensive bottles of wine, and sometimes to find the optimal schedule for
feeding my cat.
