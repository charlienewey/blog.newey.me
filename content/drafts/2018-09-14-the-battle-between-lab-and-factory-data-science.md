Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky, "two streams"

Competing data scientists inside one's head


# Laboratory

* View data science as a closed system
* Data science is a problem to be solved as well as possible
* Deferred gratification in expectation of better results (greater reward)
* Generally a mindset that performs well in academia


# Factory

* Instant gratification
* Solve problems "well enough"
* Approximations are fine, inaccuracies are fine
* Generally a business-focused mindset
