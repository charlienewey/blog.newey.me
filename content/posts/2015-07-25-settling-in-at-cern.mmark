I've been quite lax about posting lately because I've been settling in to life
in at CERN, and adjusting to living in France/Switzerland. The last couple of
weeks have been really busy; among other things, I've been meeting and
socialising with the other summer students (of which there are *a lot*),
working on my projects, having technical meetings with my supervisor, and
learning the layout of the CERN campus.

<!-- more -->

Much to my delight, I recently discovered that my office is above [Tim
Berners-Lee's][1] old room in Building 31. This is really exciting, because
Building 31 (31-2-012, to be exact) was where [Tim Berners-Lee][1] invented the
World Wide Web and  wrote the code for the first web server. As well as being
where the WWW was invented, Building 31 was where the very first web servers
were kept. That means I'm working right next to a piece of Internet history,
which is pretty damn cool.

As I've been busy with learning the technologies involved with my projects,
meeting people, going to lectures, and exploring Geneva and the surrounding
areas, I haven't had time to write much of an interesting report (at least, not
yet) - so instead of writing a monster blog post/technical report, I'll just
post some pictures of the area and some of the things I've been doing in my
free time.

The famous CERN globe, just outside the main CERN campus

![The view from my
office](/images/cern-view-from-my-office.jpg) The view from my
office (note the mountains in the background!)

![The mountain that you can see from my
office!](/images/cern-mont-saleve.jpg) The mountain you can see
from my office (Mont Sal√®ve). Yes, I went up there.  Yes, I hiked down it. In
the dark. No, I don't  recommend it.

![The antimatter factory (antiproton decelerator) near my office
building](/images/cern-antimatter-factory.jpg) The antimatter
factory (antiproton decelerator) near my office building. This is mostly just
because I found the name fascinating.

![The rather impressive murals on the ATLAS
building](/images/cern-atlas-experiment-building.jpg) The
(rather impressive) murals on the outside of the ATLAS building - which was
full of fairly tense-looking scientists on the inside.

![The ATLAS control
centre](/images/cern-atlas-experiment-control-centre.jpg) The
ATLAS experiment control centre. Nobody was running around screaming, which I
took to be a good sign :)

![The plaque outside Tim Berners-Lee's old office on the second floor of
Building 31](/images/cern-tim-berners-lee-office.jpg) The
plaque outside Tim Berners-Lee's old office on the second floor of Building 31.

![The main server room at
CERN.](/images/cern-main-server-room.jpg) CERN's main
datacentre in building 513 - there are *lots* of others but this is the most
famous one.

![My laptop looking rather fancy with its new CERN
sticker](/images/cern-sticker-on-laptop.jpg) My laptop, adorned
with a rather nice CERN sticker.

![Lake Geneva in the evening, after I went sailing on
it](/images/cern-geneva-lake.jpg) Lake Geneva, one evening -
after I went sailing on it.

Right - that's all for now. I should probably put in a quick note about my
projects - among various other things, I've been doing some interesting stuff
with Puppet, writing recipes to deploy various monitoring and metric-gathering
utilities, including Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana and OpenTSDB/`tcollector`.
I'll probably write another (lengthier) post about those things in the coming
weeks.

Salut!
