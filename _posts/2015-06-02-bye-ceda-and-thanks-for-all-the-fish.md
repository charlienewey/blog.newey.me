Today was my last day at CEDA! I can't believe it's been a full twelve months
already. It feels like just a couple of months ago that I was arriving here,
fresh from university and ready to start.

It's also now less than 25 days until I leave for CERN. Everything seems to be
happening really quickly!

Today is quite a nice coincidence, too - one of RAL Space's new satellite
instruments is ready to be shipped off to Cannes today - like me, it's leaving
RAL and won't be back for some time. It's apparently called **SLSTR**, or the
**Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer**. Because I don't have much else
to say, I'll put a picture of the SLSTR here to make this blog post at least
*mildly* interesting.

Ciao for now.
