I haven't really posted much in the last month or two, and I'm feeling guilty
for not keeping up with my blog. I've been pretty busy lately with various bits
and pieces - playing with FreeBSD, learning about ZFS, jails and various other
things, but that's another story - literally. I'll hopefully write a blog post
on those things soon - they're really interesting.

Anyway, to get back on topic - I've recently been given some good news that I
thought I should probably write about. In November last year, I discovered that
CERN were offering summer placements for technical students in their OpenLab
department. I spent a few days writing out the application form, working on my
CV, writing about some of the projects I've been involved in and so on.

Applying was a real moonshot - going to CERN has always been somewhat of a
dream of mine, and the OpenLab placements looked like great fun. I've always
wanted to see CERN but never thought I'd *actually* be able to go there.

Anyway, I submitted the application in early December and they informed me
about two weeks ago that I have been offered a placement in the ITDB department
working on a project using Elasticsearch, Hadoop and Kibana.

I can't find a way of expressing how excited I am without sounding trite, so I
don't think I'll try. Suffice it to say that I'm pretty damn excited. I've
sorted my accommodation, I've sorted my travel, and it's finally sunk in - I'm
going to Switzerland this summer to work at CERN!

Bring it on.
