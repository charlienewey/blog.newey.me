Now that I have a little extra time to write about it, I'm eager to introduce
one of my favourite University assignments from this year; my HTML5 game.

<!-- more -->

At the beginning of this project, I was really pretty unfamiliar with
JavaScript and the way it worked - I'd always regarded it as a fairly poor
language (it has a reasonable number of flaws), and not paid that much
attention to it. This assignment, while not completely changing my opinion of
the language... made me think twice about it - JavaScript is uniquely
expressive and remarkably powerful - particularly for something that can be run
inside the vast majority of web browsers.

I'm also pretty happy with how it looks; as well as writing all of the
JavaScript code and designing the structure, I draw the graphics and recorded
all of the sounds myself. I had complete control over the outcome of the
project, and I think it's turned out well! A simple game, perhaps - but
satisfying to play and pleasant to look at.

If you're interested, please check it out!
