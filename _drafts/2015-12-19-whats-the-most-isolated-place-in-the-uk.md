title: What's the Most Isolated Place in the UK?
---

I've always enjoyed exploring great open landscapes - both on foot and in cars -
that's part of the reason I studied in Aberystwyth, after all. One of the things
I've frequently noticed is that the most awe-inspiring landscapes - with the
wildest, most jaw-dropping views - tend to be in areas with little human
habitation. This is hardly a profound revelation, and yet it holds true for most
of the best landscapes in the UK. Some examples of this phenomenon immediately
spring to mind; Snowdonia, the Cambrian mountains, the Lake District, the Peak
District, the Grampians, and others - all of these heartbreakingly beautiful
landscapes are located in the sparsest and least populated corners of the
country.

This got me wondering; how easy would it be to find the *least populated* part
of the UK - and were the landscapes as likely to be lush and wild as I
suspected? Of course, there's only one way to find out - to look at every
populated area in the country and find the largest open space.
